# Our Oceans, Our Plastic

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

*Our Oceans, Our Plastic* is a fictional organisation that aims aims to inform the general public about plastic waste in our 
oceans. My aim with this project was to create a website that allows to user to learn more about the issues of plastic waste 
in an interactive way, keeping them interested, inspired and motivated to continue to learn more. 

The idea for this project came to me as I believe that plastic waste in our oceans is an important topic to discuss and I wanted
to create an unintimidating environment to learn more abot it. As I had just covered an introductory module on JavaScript, I 
decided to implement JavaScript in different ways throughout my project: with a Google Maps API, a short interactive quiz, 
animated arrows to guide the user on and a form to subscribe to a fictional newsletter. 

This was the second of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at *The Code Institute*. 
The main requirements were to make an interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## UX

### Main aims

- To provide a platform for users to learn more about plastic waste in the oceans in an interactive and intuitive way.

- To make the website interactive through the use of JavaScript, with a Google Maps API feature, a quiz and the chance to sign up to a newsletter.

- To make learning about the plastic waste problem seem exiting to users, by creating a project that both teaches and then tests the user on what they've learnt.

- To make it easy for users to make their way through each feature on the website, by having a clear menu bar but also including links to different parts of the website throughout with a consistent design.

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

1. I am a user who has never really considered that plastic waste in our oceans might be a problem. I want to use this website to learn more about the problem and want to see how much I've actually now learnt by taking the quiz.

2. I am a user who wants to stay up to date on the plastic waste problem, preferably with the latest news and tips on what I can do to help.

3. I am a primary school teacher who wants to discuss plastic waste with my students. I think it would be useful to introduce them to the topic then test them on what they've learnt. 

4. I am a user who primarily uses an iPad Pro to browse websites. I want to have a good experience on this website and view all the features in an equally aesthetic way. 

5. I am one of the creators of this platform. I would like to attract users in the hope of raising awarenss about plastic waste in our oceans and increasing our newsletter followers.

### Design Process

1. I began the design process by outlining the key features that I wanted my website to have, with a focus on the JavaScript that I wanted to experiment with and ultimately implement. This led me to decide that I wanted to focus on three key features: a page with a Google Maps API, a quiz to test users and the chance for them to sign up to a newsletter. This helped me to formulate the structure of my design, with five seperate pages: 'Home', 'A Plastic Problem', 'Quiz', 'Results', 'Newsletter'.

2. For my design to work, I knew it would be important to create a theme that would keep the user interested in the topic. Thinking of plastic waste can feel overwhelming, as it is such an intimidating topic with solutions that are not yet fully clear to us. My first design decision was therefore to make the website seem welcoming, rather than daunting, with light colours and images of plastic waste that would not be shocking enough to prevent the user from continuing on (as this would of course prevent them from learning, which is one of the main objectives).

3. I then considered the pace that I wanted to user to navigate the website. I wanted it to be easy for them to use the menu to move between each page, but that they would mostly rely on the strategically placed buttons taking them through each page in order. This would keep the pace going as they swiftly move through the design, learning throughout the process before ultimately signing up to the newsletter.

4. I started a workspace on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Hv9GYC33ydTGLuwIxydgRr/Code-Institute?node-id=170%3A1) and began experimenting with my wireframe. As with my first Milestone Project, I found it useful to have my hero image in place to extract complementary colors for the theme from it. I also began designing my logo ideas on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAD-9OmoVNg/wbnoii0XoGRt1jnc77ivOQ/view?utm_content=DAD-9OmoVNg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) as I felt this would be important to the theme of the design. In the end I settled with a blue and yellow theme: the blue (#528FCB) was extracted from the hero image and represents the ocean, whilst the yellow (#F5F862) complements the blue color and sybolises the hope of solving the problem and sets a 'fun' and interactive tone for the design.

5. With the wireframes complete, I began experimenting with the quiz in a seperate workspace to create the JavaScript needed to make this aspect of my project work. I created the basic structure and code with HTML and JavaScript and the repository can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mkthewlis/quiz-practice).  

> Note: Throughout the design process, I kept referring back to my original 'Main Aims' and 'User Stories' to make sure that my project was developing as intended.
