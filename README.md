## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

*Our Oceans, Our Plastic* is a fictional organisation that aims aims to inform the general public about plastic waste in our 
oceans. My aim with this project was to create a website that allows to user to learn more about the issues of plastic waste 
in an interactive way, keeping them interested, inspired and motivated to continue to learn more. 

The idea for this project came to me as I believe that plastic waste in our oceans is an important topic to discuss and I wanted
to create an unintimidating environment to learn more abot it. As I had just covered an introductory module on JavaScript, I 
decided to implement JavaScript in different ways throughout my project: with a Google Maps API, a short interactive quiz, 
animated arrows to guide the user on and a form to subscribe to a fictional newsletter. 

This was the second of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at *The Code Institute*. 
The main requirements were to make an interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
